# 🌸 Generative Motion Studies

Live demo here: https://a41900.github.io/generative-motion-studies/

This repository contains a set of generative motion and particle system studies built with JavaScript and Canvas.

It originally started as a creative landing page. As development progressed, more interactions, effects and ideas were added, and the project slowly shifted from focusing on visual output to understanding how motion systems are structured and behave.

At a certain point, it became clear that the most valuable part of the project was no longer the landing page itself, but the exploration behind it. Because of that, the project was intentionally migrated into a study-focused repository.

This is not a finished product. It exists as a space to explore particle systems, motion logic, abstraction and generative behaviour through simple rules. The visual results are a consequence of that process, not the main goal.

This repository now serves as a foundation for future visual projects, such as landing pages and interactive pieces. Development notes and reflections are documented in the devlog, and the system is designed to be modular and reusable across different contexts.
