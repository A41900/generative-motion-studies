# 🌸 Creative Landing Page — Generative Particles

demo here: https://a41900.github.io/portfolio-landing/

This repository contains my personal landing page.
It started as a simple idea and slowly became a space where I explore generative visuals, interaction and code structure using JavaScript and Canvas.
I researched generative art and particle systems, looked at existing approaches, and then built my own variation through experimentation. The goal was never to copy an existing solution, but to understand how these systems behave and shape something personal from that understanding.
At this point, the project reached a stable version. Many ideas were happening at once, and instead of continuing to add more, I decided to freeze this iteration as a reference point.
This version represents a moment in the project where the system works, even if it is not finished. I plan to keep evolving it in future iterations, with more intention and clarity, but this snapshot matters to me as part of the process.

The project serves both as a landing page and as a portfolio piece.
