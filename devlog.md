Devlog — Landing Page

# 23/12

Today I decided to stop.
Not because the project is done, but because too many things started to happen at the same time. Particles, text, interaction, layout, effects — everything was working, but it felt noisy.
I realised I enjoy exploring ideas, but I also need to understand what I’m building. Freezing this version feels like creating a pause, not an ending.
This project is teaching me that experimentation is important, but structure is what allows experimentation to continue without becoming chaos.
I’m leaving this version here as it is — stable, imperfect, and honest.
